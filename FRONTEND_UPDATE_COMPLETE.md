## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required):
1. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node migrate-products.js
   ```
   This will convert existing products to new schema and create inventory items.

2. **Test the Updated Components**:
   - Create a test product
   - Add inventory to it
   - Verify data in database

### Future Enhancements (Optional):
1. **Update ProductsManagement.jsx**:
   - Show total stock (aggregated from inventory)
   - Show number of batches
   - Add "Add Inventory" button per product
   - Update detail view

2. **Create InventoryManagement.jsx**:
   - View all inventory items
   - Filter by product, status, expiry
   - Adjust stock quantities
   - View transaction history

3. **Update EditProduct.jsx**:
   - Remove stock fields (same as AddProduct)
   - Show inventory summary
   - Link to manage inventory

4. **Update Issue System**:
   - Deduct from specific inventory items (batch-based)
   - FIFO/FEFO support

## 📚 Key Points

### Product Master Data (AddProduct):
- **Purpose**: Define what the product is
- **Fields**: Name, SKU, Category, Description, Manufacturer, Supplier, Unit
- **Optional**: Default prices, default storage
- **No Stock**: Products don't have stock directly

### Inventory Items (AddInventory):
- **Purpose**: Track actual stock with batch details
- **Unique Key**: Product + Batch + Expiry + Manufacture Date
- **Required**: Quantity, Prices (can override product defaults)
- **Flexible**: Each batch can have different prices, storage, supplier

### Benefits:
1. **Multiple Batches**: Track different batches of same product
2. **Batch-Specific Prices**: Each batch can have different buying/selling prices
3. **FIFO/FEFO Ready**: Can dispense from earliest expiring batches first
4. **Detailed Tracking**: Full transaction history per batch
5. **Compliance**: Prevents selling expired stock (auto-detection)

## 🔍 Validation Rules

### AddProduct:
- **Required**: Name, SKU, Category, Unit
- **Optional**: All prices, supplier info, descriptions
- **Constraints**: 
  - If max stock set, must be > min stock
  - If default prices set, selling >= buying

### AddInventory:
- **Required**: Product, Batch Number, Manufacture Date, Expiry Date, Quantity, Buying Price, Selling Price
- **Optional**: Storage, Supplier, Purchase Date, Receipt, Notes
- **Constraints**:
  - Quantity > 0
  - Prices > 0
  - Selling Price >= Buying Price
  - Expiry Date > Manufacture Date
  - Expiry Date > Today
  - Unique: Product + Batch + Expiry + Manufacture

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot read property 'inventoryItems' of undefined"
**Solution**: Make sure the API is imported correctly:
```javascript
import inventoryAPI from '../../api/inventory';
// Use: inventoryAPI.default.inventoryItems.addInventoryItem()
```

### Issue: Duplicate batch error
**Solution**: This is expected behavior. Each batch with unique expiry/manufacture dates should be separate. If trying to add to existing batch, use stock adjustment instead.

### Issue: Default prices not showing
**Solution**: Ensure product has `defaultBuyingPrice` and `defaultSellingPrice` fields set.
