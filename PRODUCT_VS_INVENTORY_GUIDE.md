# Quick Reference: Product vs Inventory Management

## üü¢ Product Management (Master Data)

### Purpose
Create product definitions - the "catalog" of what products exist in your pharmacy.

### When to Use
- Adding a new type of product to your catalog
- Defining product properties that don't change
- Setting up product categories and classifications

### What It Does
- Creates a product record with basic information
- NO stock quantities
- NO batch tracking
- NO expiry dates

### Route
`/pharmacist/products/add`

### Example
```
Product: Paracetamol 500mg Tablets
SKU: PARA-500-TAB
Category: Analgesics
Unit: tablets
Min Stock Alert: 100 tablets
Default Storage: Shelf A1
```

---

## üîµ Inventory Management (Stock Tracking)

### Purpose
Add actual physical stock to products with batch-level tracking.

### When to Use
- After receiving a shipment
- Adding stock to an existing product
- Tracking different batches of the same product

### What It Does
- Creates an inventory record linked to a product
- Tracks actual quantities
- Records batch numbers
- Tracks expiry and manufacture dates
- Records purchase details

### Route
`/pharmacist/inventory/add`

### Example
```
Product: Paracetamol 500mg Tablets (select from dropdown)
Batch: BATCH-2024-001
Quantity: 1000 tablets
Buying Price: LKR 5 per tablet

2. Enter product name, SKU, category
3. Set stock thresholds (optional)
4. Set default prices (optional)
5. Save

### Step 2: Add Inventory (EVERY SHIPMENT)
1. Go to **Inventory Management** ‚Üí Add Stock/Batch
2. Select the product from dropdown
3. Enter batch number
4. Enter quantity received
5. Enter prices for this batch
6. Enter manufacture and expiry dates
7. Enter supplier and receipt details
8. Save

### Step 3: Repeat Step 2
Every time you receive a new shipment, even if it's the same product:

- Same product + Different expiry = New inventory record ‚úÖ
- Same product + Same batch + Same dates = Error (duplicate) ‚ùå
