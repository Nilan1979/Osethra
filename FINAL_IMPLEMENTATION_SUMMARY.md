## 📊 System Architecture

### Data Flow

```
1. CREATE PRODUCT (Master Data)
   ↓
   AddProduct.jsx → ProductModel
   - Name, SKU, Category
   - Manufacturer
   - Prescription Required
   - Unit, Barcode, Status

2. ADD INVENTORY (Stock/Batches)
   ↓
   AddInventory.jsx → InventoryItemModel
   - Select Product (from dropdown)
   - Batch Details (batch#, dates)
   - Pricing (buy/sell per batch)
   - Quantity
   - Storage & Supplier

3. VIEW INVENTORY (All Batches)
   ↓
   InventoryManagement.jsx
   - List all inventory items
   - Filter by status, expiry
   - Search by product/batch
   - Edit/Delete items
```

### Database Structure

#### Products Collection
```javascript
{
  name: "Paracetamol 500mg",
  sku: "PARA-500",
  category: "Analgesics",
  description: "Pain relief medication",
  unit: "tablets",
  barcode: "123456789",
  manufacturer: "ABC Pharma",
  prescription: false,
  status: "active",
  notes: "Common medication"
}
```

#### InventoryItems Collection
```javascript
{
  product: ObjectId("..."),        // Reference to Product
  batchNumber: "BATCH-2024-001",
  quantity: 1000,
  buyingPrice: 5.00,
  sellingPrice: 10.00,
  manufactureDate: "2024-01-15",
  expiryDate: "2026-01-15",
  storageLocation: "Shelf A1",
  supplierName: "Medical Supplies Ltd",
  purchaseDate: "2024-10-14",
  receiptNumber: "INV-2024-001",
  notes: "First batch"
}
```

### Unique Constraint
Prevents duplicate batches:
```javascript
{ product, batchNumber, expiryDate, manufactureDate } // Must be unique
```
