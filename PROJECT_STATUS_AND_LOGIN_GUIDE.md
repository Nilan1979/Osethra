## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. **Cannot Connect to MongoDB**
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017
```
**Solution:**
- Ensure MongoDB is running: `mongod` command
- Check MongoDB connection string in `.env`
- For Atlas: Verify credentials and network access

#### 2. **Login Failed / Invalid Credentials**
**Solution:**
- Verify you ran `node seed-doctor.js`
- Check database has the user: Use MongoDB Compass or CLI
- Try creating a new user via registration

#### 3. **Port Already in Use**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5000
```
**Solution:**
- Kill process on port 5000:
  ```bash
  # Windows
  netstat -ano | findstr :5000
  taskkill /PID <PID> /F
  
  # Linux/Mac
  lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
  ```
- Or change PORT in `.env`

#### 4. **CORS Errors**
**Solution:**
- Server already configured for ports 5173 and 5174
- If using different port, update `server/app.js` CORS config

#### 5. **Dashboard Not Loading**
**Solution:**
- Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
- Verify token in localStorage
- Check network tab for API calls
- Ensure server is running and accessible

#### 6. **No Appointments Showing**
**Solution:**
- Run seed script: `node seed-doctor.js`
- Create appointments manually via UI
- Check doctor ID matches in appointments
