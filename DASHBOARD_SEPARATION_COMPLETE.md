# Dashboard Separation - Product vs Inventory Management

## Overview
Updated the Pharmacist Dashboard to clearly separate **Product Management** (master data) from **Inventory Management** (batch-level stock tracking) with distinct visual sections.

---

## What Changed

### PharmacistDashboard.jsx

#### 1. **Removed Single "Quick Actions" Section**
Previously had one unified section with all actions mixed together.

#### 2. **Created Three Separate Action Groups**

##### A. Product Management Actions
```javascript
const productManagementActions = [
  {
    title: 'View Products',
    description: 'View all product definitions',
    route: '/pharmacist/products',
  },
  {
    title: 'Add New Product',
    description: 'Create product master data',
    route: '/pharmacist/products/add',
  },
];
```

##### B. Inventory Management Actions
```javascript
const inventoryManagementActions = [
  {
    title: 'View Inventory',
    description: 'View all stock & batches',
    route: '/pharmacist/inventory',
  },
  {
    title: 'Add Stock/Batch',
    description: 'Add inventory to products',
    route: '/pharmacist/inventory/add',
  },
  {
    title: 'Stock Alerts',
    description: 'View low stock & expiry',
    route: '/pharmacist/alerts',
  },
];
```

##### C. Other Quick Actions
```javascript
const otherQuickActions = [
  { title: 'Issue Products', ... },
  { title: 'Prescriptions', ... },
  { title: 'Issue History', ... },
  { title: 'Reports', ... },
];
```

#### 3. **Created Distinct Visual Sections**

##### Product Management Card (Green Theme)
- **Border Color**: `#2e7d32` (Green)
- **Background**: `#f1f8f4` (Light green)
- **Icon**: `InventoryIcon`
- **Title**: "Product Management"
- **Subtitle**: "Manage product master data & definitions"
- **Layout**: Two action cards (View Products, Add New Product)

##### Inventory Management Card (Blue Theme)
- **Border Color**: `#0288d1` (Blue)
- **Background**: `#e3f2fd` (Light blue)
- **Icon**: `PharmacyIcon`
- **Title**: "Inventory Management"
- **Subtitle**: "Manage stock, batches & inventory tracking"
- **Layout**: Three action cards (View Inventory, Add Stock/Batch, Stock Alerts)

##### Other Quick Actions Section
- Regular horizontal grid layout
- 4 columns on desktop, responsive on mobile
- Contains: Issue Products, Prescriptions, Issue History, Reports

---

## Visual Improvements

### 1. **Color Coding**
- **Green** = Product Management (master data)

- Bordered container with theme color
- Hover effects with smooth transitions

### 3. **Action Cards Enhancement**
- Larger clickable areas

## Next Steps

### üî¥ High Priority - Missing Component
**Create `InventoryManagement.jsx`**
- Route: `/pharmacist/inventory`
- Purpose: View all inventory items across all products
- Features needed:
  - List all batches with product details
  - Filter by product, batch number, status, expiry
  - Show: Product name, SKU, Batch, Quantity, Prices, Expiry, Storage
  - Actions: View details, Edit batch, Adjust stock
  - Sorting and pagination
  - Export to CSV/Excel
  
### üü° Medium Priority - Update Existing Component
**Update `ProductsManagement.jsx`**
- Add "View Inventory" button for each product
- Show aggregated stock summary from all batches
- Add quick link to add inventory for specific product
- Remove batch-level information (now in inventory view)

### üü¢ Low Priority
1. Update `EditProduct.jsx` to match `AddProduct.jsx` changes
2. Add route guard to ensure `/pharmacist/inventory` exists
3. Consider adding inventory analytics to dashboard stats
4. Add "Quick Add Inventory" button in Product Management section

## Summary

The Pharmacist Dashboard now clearly distinguishes between:

1. **Product Management** üü¢
   - Creating and editing product definitions (master data)
   - Managing product catalog
   - Setting default prices and storage locations

2. **Inventory Management** üîµ
   - Adding stock with batch details
   - Tracking expiry dates and manufacturing dates
   - Managing storage and quantities
   - Viewing stock alerts

This separation makes the system more intuitive and aligns with the backend architecture where Products are master records and InventoryItems are batch-level stock entries.

**Visual Result**: Users now see two distinct, color-coded sections that clearly indicate the difference between managing product definitions (green) and managing actual stock/inventory (blue).
