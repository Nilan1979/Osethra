# ✅ Product Availability & Low Stock Notifications - COMPLETED

## What Was Added

### 🎯 Core Features:
1. **Auto-calculated Availability Status**
   - 🟢 In Stock (quantity > minStock)
   - 🟡 Low Stock (quantity ≤ minStock)
   - 🔴 Out of Stock (quantity = 0)

2. **Stock Threshold Configuration**
   - Minimum Stock Level (default: 10)
   - Reorder Point (default: 20)
   - Batch-specific thresholds

3. **Smart Reorder Recommendations**
   - Auto-calculated recommended quantities
   - Formula: `max(reorderPoint × 2 - currentQty, minStock)`

4. **Enhanced Stock Alerts API**
   - 5 alert types: low-stock, out-of-stock, needs-reorder, expiring, expired
   - Comprehensive statistics and summaries
   - Product details included

## Files Modified

### Backend (3 files):
1. ✅ **server/Model/InventoryItemModel.js**
   - Added `minStock`, `reorderPoint`, `availability` fields
   - Enhanced pre-save middleware for auto-calculation
   - Added virtual properties: `stockStatus`, `needsReorder`, `recommendedReorderQty`

2. ✅ **server/Controllers/InventoryController.js**
   - Updated `addInventoryItem` to accept thresholds
   - Returns low stock alerts in response
   - Completely rewrote `getStockAlerts` for InventoryItems

### Frontend (1 file):
3. ✅ **client/src/pages/inventory/AddInventory.jsx**
   - Added Minimum Stock Level field
   - Added Reorder Point field
   - Added real-time availability status chip
   - Enhanced submission with alert handling

## How It Works

### When Adding Inventory:
```
User enters:
- Quantity: 5
- Min Stock: 10
- Reorder Point: 20

System automatically:
✅ Sets availability = 'low-stock' (5 ≤ 10)
✅ Calculates recommended reorder: 35 units
✅ Returns alert: "Product is running low"
✅ Shows warning snackbar to user
```

### Stock Alerts Endpoint:
```
GET /api/inventory/alerts?type=low-stock

Returns:
{
  data: {
    lowStock: [{
      productName: "Paracetamol",
      quantity: 5,
      minStock: 10,
      stockPercentage: "50.00",
      recommendedReorderQty: 35
    }]
  },
  summary: {
    lowStockCount: 3,
    totalAlerts: 11
  }
}
```

## Testing

### ✅ To Test Immediately:

1. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Add inventory with low stock:**
   - Go to "Add Inventory" page
   - Select a product
   - Enter Quantity: 5
   - Enter Min Stock: 10
   - Enter Reorder Point: 20
   - Submit
   - Should show: 🔴 LOW STOCK chip
   - Should get warning message

3. **Test different scenarios:**
   - Qty=30, Min=10, Reorder=20 → 🟢 IN STOCK
   - Qty=15, Min=10, Reorder=20 → 🟡 REORDER SOON
   - Qty=5, Min=10, Reorder=20 → 🔴 LOW STOCK

4. **Check alerts API:**
   ```
   GET http://localhost:5000/api/inventory/alerts?type=low-stock
   ```
