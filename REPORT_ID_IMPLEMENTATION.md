# Report ID Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added unique Report IDs to all PDF reports for better tracking, auditing, and reference purposes.

---

## Implementation Date
**October 15, 2025**

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Helper Function Added
**File**: `server/Controllers/ReportsController.js`

Created a utility function to generate unique report IDs:

```javascript
function generateReportId(reportType) {
    const timestamp = Date.now();
    const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000).toString().padStart(3, '0');
    const prefix = reportType.substring(0, 3).toUpperCase();
    return `${prefix}-${timestamp}-${random}`;
}
```

### 2. PDF Generation Functions Updated

All four PDF generation functions now include unique Report IDs:

#### A. Stock Status Report PDF
- **Function**: `generateStockStatusPDF()`
- **Report ID Format**: `STO-[timestamp]-[random]`
- **Example**: `STO-1729012345678-123`
- **Location in PDF**: Below title, above generation timestamp

#### B. Batch & Expiry Report PDF
- **Function**: `generateBatchExpiryPDF()`
- **Report ID Format**: `BAT-[timestamp]-[random]`
- **Example**: `BAT-1729012345678-456`
- **Location in PDF**: Below title, above generation timestamp

#### C. Issues/Dispensing Report PDF
- **Function**: `generateIssuesReportPDF()`
- **Report ID Format**: `ISS-[timestamp]-[random]`
- **Example**: `ISS-1729012345678-789`
- **Location in PDF**: Below title, above generation timestamp

#### D. Sales & Revenue Report PDF
- **Function**: `generateSalesRevenuePDF()`
- **Report ID Format**: `SAL-[timestamp]-[random]`
- **Example**: `SAL-1729012345678-012`
- **Location in PDF**: Below title, above generation timestamp

## Report ID Structure

### Components
1. **Prefix (3 characters)**: Identifies report type
   - `STO` - Stock Status Report
   - `BAT` - Batch & Expiry Report
   - `ISS` - Issues/Dispensing Report
   - `SAL` - Sales & Revenue Report

2. **Timestamp (13 digits)**: Unix timestamp in milliseconds
   - Ensures chronological ordering
   - Provides exact generation time
   - Example: `1729012345678`

3. **Random Number (3 digits)**: Additional uniqueness
   - Range: 000-999
   - Prevents collision if multiple reports generated in same millisecond
   - Example: `123`

### Format
```
[PREFIX]-[TIMESTAMP]-[RANDOM]
```

### Example Report IDs
```
STO-1729012345678-123  (Stock Status Report)
BAT-1729012345678-456  (Batch & Expiry Report)
ISS-1729012345678-789  (Issues Report)
SAL-1729012345678-012  (Sales & Revenue Report)
```

## PDF Layout

### Before Report ID
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│    Stock Status Report              │
│                                     │
│    Generated: 10/15/2025, 2:30 PM  │
│                                     │
│    Summary                          │
│    ...                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After Report ID
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│    Stock Status Report              │
│                                     │
│    Report ID: STO-1729012345678-123│

## Usage Examples

### User Scenario 1: Filing Reports
```
Pharmacist: "I need to reference the stock report from this morning."
Admin: "What's the Report ID?"
Pharmacist: "STO-1729012345678-123"
Admin: "Found it, checking now..."
```

### User Scenario 2: Compliance Audit
```
Auditor: "Show me the sales report for September."
System: Searches by Report ID: SAL-1728*
Result: All September sales reports retrieved by timestamp range
```

### User Scenario 3: Troubleshooting
```
User: "The batch report shows incorrect data."
Support: "What's the Report ID?"
User: "BAT-1729012345678-456"
Support: Checks generation time, filters used, data state at that moment
```

## Support Information

### Common Questions

**Q: Can two reports have the same ID?**
A: Extremely unlikely. The combination of timestamp (millisecond precision) and random number (1000 possibilities) makes collisions nearly impossible.

**Q: Where is the Report ID stored?**
A: Currently only in the PDF. Future versions will store in database.

**Q: Can I search by Report ID?**
A: Not yet. This feature is planned for future implementation.

**Q: Is the Report ID visible in the JSON response?**
A: Not currently. Only in PDF exports. Can be added to JSON if needed.

**Q: What if I need to regenerate a report?**
A: Each generation creates a new Report ID. The new report will have different data reflecting current state.
